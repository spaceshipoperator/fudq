fundamentally users, data sources and queries.

[[https://meddadada.com/images/an_erd_fudq.png]]

a *user* can create *data sources*

a user can view and modify the description and definition of data sources that he or she has created

if a data source is shared, other users can view its description (but *not* its definition) and write queries against it

a user can create *queries* against available data sources

if a query is shared, other users can view its description (*and* definition, but *not* its data source *unless* the data source is also shared)

if a query is shared *and* its associated data source is shared, other users can execute the query to retrieve results

** purpose
to provide the simplest means of sharing data from an arbitrary source with others on the web

think of this as a minimal, RESTful means of running arbitrary queries against arbitrary data sources, in order to make it easy to share data with others

** background
with a nod toward the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy][Unix tradition]] and starting with [[https://gist.github.com/1327195][one of]] the simplest [[https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki/Examples][examples]] using [[https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki][warden]] (for user authentication) and [[http://www.sinatrarb.com/][sinatra]],

#+begin_src sh :exports code :eval no-export
echo "tmp/*" >> .gitignore
mkdir tmp
git clone https://gist.github.com/8043506.git tmp/gist
cp tmp/gist/gistfile1.rb fudq.rb
#+end_src

from there you can follow the commits

and here's a working list of things yet to be done

** tasks
  - [ ] need a more sane page layout and a little css love
    not sure why or what for teh css @import within a style tag, but to pull that off in slim keep in mind
    http://rdoc.info/gems/slim/file/README.md#Output_without_HTML_escaping___
  - [ ] query titles should not be links when not authenticated
  - [ ] FIX save data source is busted
    error at /d/2 757: unexpected token at '{"user"=>"guest",
  - [ ] set javascript includes protocol http/https accordingly
  - [ ] create sandbox pg database and fudq data source (for admin user shared)
  - [ ] "run" link on query page, return data to div
  - [ ] figure best way to delete or disable a data source (w/o orphaned queries)
  - [ ] consider save and share results
  - [ ] create a data source in order to query the fudq git repository
    considering [[https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/git-the-nosql-database][git as a nosql]] [[http://opensoul.org/2011/09/01/git-the-nosql-database/][database]], demonstrate a query against it in fudq
  - [ ] create data source to query locus via shell
  - [ ] integrate [[http://mleibman.github.io/SlickGrid/examples/example1-simple.html][slickgrid]] on query page
  - [ ] new (or register) user process, post username, email, password, confirm
  - [ ] need to get some [[http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html][unit tests]] (but start with the model)
  - [ ] rake task to initialize (or migrate) database
  - [ ] create hash of user password (maybe with [[http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#Quick-start_Guide][crypto-js]])
  - [ ] allow for query input args (ala parameterized views, table-valued functions)
  - [ ] resolve "SECURITY WARNING: No secret option provided to Rack::Session::Cookie."
    because I'm a sloppy developer...running with scissors
  - [ ] DRY up slim fo data_source and query checkbox and select lists
  - [ ] DRY up save query and data source logic
  - [ ] handle streaming results, queries against nosql datasources
  - [ ] break up the app into multiple files, modularize...growing need for a framework
    consider reproducible (tangle/weave) org file that keeps all the code along with the documentation
    consider [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5015471/using-sinatra-for-larger-projects-via-multiple-files][SO - using sinatra w/ multiple files]]
