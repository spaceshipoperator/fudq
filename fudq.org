[[https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/fudq][fudq]] intends to be nothing more than fundamentally users, datasources and queries.

More specifically:

A user can create datasources and modify and/or share datasources that he or she has created.

A user can create queries and edit queries he or she has created against an available datasource.

A query may be shared in either of two ways, it's "definition" (read only text of the query itself) and/or its "results" (given optional input parameters)

Any shared queries against shared data sources are executable by everyone

** tasks
*** TODO make view/edit form for query
*** TODO refactor Main before block, maybe instantiate user there
*** TODO create /x execute query route, return results if permitted
*** TODO create hash of user password (maybe with [[http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#Quick-start_Guide][crypto-js]])
*** TODO resolve "SECURITY WARNING: No secret option provided to Rack::Session::Cookie."
