Starting with [[http://blog.refractalize.org/post/3141970594/warden-and-sinatra][one of]] the simplest [[https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki/Examples][examples]] using [[https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki][warden]] (for user authentification) with [[http://www.sinatrarb.com/][sinatra]], [[https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/fudq][fudq]] intends to be nothing more than fundamentally users, datasources and queries.  

More specifically:

A user owns datasources and queries against those datasources. 

A user can create datasources and modify datasources that he or she has created.

A datasource may be shared in one of two ways, by "definition" or by "use"

A user can create and edit queries against an available datasource.

A query may be shared in either of two ways, it's "definition" (read only text of the query itself) and/or its "use" (results given optional input parameters)
