[[https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/fudq][fudq]] intends to be nothing more than fundamentally users, datasources and queries.

More specifically:

A user can create datasources and modify and/or share datasources that he or she has created.

A user can create queries and edit queries he or she has created against an available datasource.

A query may be shared in either of two ways, it's "definition" (read only text of the query itself) and/or its "results" (given optional input parameters)

Any shared queries against shared data sources are executable by everyone

*** tasks
**** DONE factor query_action out of User
**** DONE complete query delete, need to handle data source delete a bit different
data source cannot be deleted if queries reference it...else orphaned
**** DONE complete execute query, return results in json dump

http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/json.html
**** DONE link to execute query in home list and on query edit page, as appropriate
**** DONE wire up to postgres
create a jobs database owned by fudq/fudq localhost...with a single table:

create role jobs login encrypted password 'jobs' noinherit valid until 'infinity';
create database jobs with encoding='utf8' owner=jobs;

| job_id | last_name | salary |
|   1234 | person1   |   2500 |
|   7896 | person2   |   2600 |
|  01254 | person3   |   2800 |
|   8565 | person4   |   2900 |
|  66525 | person5   |   3100 |
|   8897 | person6   |  11000 |
|  56456 | person7   |  66788 |
|  78676 | person8   |   7656 |

create table jobs (job_id int, last_name text, salary int);
\copy jobs from './tmp/jobs.csv' delimiter ','

db = Sequel.connect('postgres://jobs:jobs@localhost/jobs) # Uses the postgres adapter
**** DONE integrate [[http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about][ace]] for data source and query definitions
tried [[http://codemirror.net/index.html][codemirror]], felt clunky
**** TODO do not display data source on query page unless editable
**** TODO need type field on data source page
**** TODO execute button on query page, return data to div
**** TODO integrate [[http://mleibman.github.io/SlickGrid/examples/example1-simple.html][slickgrid]] on query page
**** TODO new (or register) user process, post username, email, password, confirm
**** TODO need to get some [[http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html][unit tests]] (but start with the model)
**** TODO rake task to initialize (or migrate) database
**** TODO create hash of user password (maybe with [[http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#Quick-start_Guide][crypto-js]])
**** TODO resolve "SECURITY WARNING: No secret option provided to Rack::Session::Cookie."
**** TODO DRY up slim fo data_source and query checkbox and select lists
**** TODO DRY up save query and data source logic
